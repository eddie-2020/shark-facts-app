# Sharks_facts
Here in this demo app I have created a fact application that allows users to post facts with thier name included, I have also created few option to the created fact like `Show`: to show the users created facts, `Edit`: to edit and update the users facts and `Destroy`: to delete created facts(WARNING: once deleted you can't restore your facts), Notice that there's a buttom in directly at the bottom in the Sharks home page where you can create new facts.
